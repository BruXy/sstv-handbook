\chapter{Modern SSTV features}

A milestone between methods of old and modern SSTV image
transmission is, without doubt, the usage of semiconductor memory
chips. The creation of the first converters between fast and
slow-scan television signals was credited to the existence of
permanent image storage in memory. Consequently, image
transmission could be improved because the usage of long
persistence CRTs, which had been a  major constraining fact, was
now eliminated. Thanks to it, some new formats with longer
transmission time were developed. They brought more quality to
black and white transmission and helped to develop colour image
transmission.


There was a trend in the design of new formats that created
several modes in each system. There were modes with faster
transmission and lower resolution and on the other hand, modes
for the transfer of higher quality images but longer time
length. There is a possibility to change between them according
to the actual band condition.

The early phases of development were influenced by two
companies~-- the American {\em Robot Research Inc.} and the
German {\em Wraase Electronic\/} led by radio amateur Volker
Wraase, DL2RZ. Each of them introduced an SSTV converter that
used each company's own transmission system. The systems are
different in the usage of colour coding, scan line formats, and
synchronization methods. Their converters provide several modes.
{\em Mode} denotes a format of image transmission, its
resolution, and transfer speed.

As often happens, the professional device did not fully satisfy
ham radio users. So new systems with more modes were implemented
into the converter firmware. And they were also re-implemented
into other devices to ensure compatibility. Sometimes a new
genuine system was designed to overcome imperfections found in
the classic predecessors.

The number of those systems has grown unbelievably. Recently
they were new systems created for better utilization of modern
computer potentials. Modern personal computers with the
necessary equipment, are full successors of SSTV converters. The
advantage of computers is especially bigger memory and better
image resolution.

If we were to count the number of all SSTV modes, we would find
approximately 70! So it is possible to transfer SSTV images via
seventy different modes, which are mutually different in
transmission time, resolution, colour coding, etc. The vast
majority of them are absolutely unique and incompatible\ldots

You might be a little scared by the previous paragraphs, but let
me reassure you that only a few modes are actually used.

European amateurs widely used the SSTV mode called~{\em Martin
M1}, but in recent times other modes; {\em Martin M2} and {\em
Scottie S2} are also in use. A special mode used {\em Scottie
DX}; is characterized by the very high image quality. And the
mode {\em Robot 36 Color} is undertaken in space communication.

Fortunately, all modern converters and computer software are
able to operate with these popular modes, so the problem that
two stations can not establish the QSO should not occur.

A digital vertical synchronization for automatic mode selection
will be described shortly because every mode uses a digital
header for its identification. Thanks to this any SSTV device
can automatically switch to the correct mode and begin
reception. Computer software also supports mode detection by
measuring the elapsed time between two successive sync. impulses
of image lines.

More details will be described in the following chapters.

\section{Signal modulation}

\subsection[bandwidth]{Bandwidth}

Different communication channels, whether wired or wireless,
have several characteristics, which define their behaviour in
the transfer of effective signals. These include for example
{\em attenuation}. Attenuation defines how much the
communication channel reduces a transferred signal. Another
important characteristic is the {\em bias}, which refers to the
various distortions that occur due to imperfections within the
communication path.

There are several negative influences, that affect signal
transfer within a communication path. Their effects are not
negligible. The intensity of this effect depends also on the
frequency of the signal. Generally, it is always possible to
identify a range of frequencies that a particular transmission
path can transfer well and outside this frequency range the
transmission is too poor.

The signal bandwidth does not depend only on the frequency range
used for modulation, in our case 1,500\,Hz to 2,300\,Hz, but
also on the signal spectrum.

{\em Fourier analysis} is used to determine the spectrum
bandwidth. The analysis can express any waveform in the form of
the sum of a large number of sine waves~-- harmonic components.

Limited bandwidth has the effect that the harmonic components
lying inside this band will be transferred more or less without
blemish and other harmonic components pass with a huge
distortion or not at all (more
in~\single{\in{chapter}[chap7::sampling],
\at{page}[chap7::sampling]}{\in{chapter}[sampling],
\at{page}[sampling]}).

{\em Bandwidth} can be seen as a characteristic of the
transmission path given by the range of the signal spectrum.

The basic rule for the required bandwidth is called {\em Nyquist
rate}. Its definition is that optimal bandwidth equals half of
modulation speed.  It is true that the necessary bandwidth
increases with the amount of transferred information per time
unit.

\subsection{Modulation techniques of analog SSTV}

An SSTV broadcast is usually carried out using single-sideband
(SSB) amplitude modulation with a common ham radio transceiver.
Frequencies above 2,500\,Hz are strongly suppressed, so the
frequency of white colour, the maximal level of an SSTV signal,
was chosen at 2,300\,Hz.

SSTV signals are transmitted via frequency modulation of an
audio signal. To avoid any phase shift and drift (which both
have a negative impact on picture quality), the spectrum of the
video signal is modulated on the auxiliary carrier frequency
1900\,Hz~-- {\em sub-carrier}. This modulation method is called
{\em Sub-carrier frequency modulation (SFCM)}.

The frequency of video signals varies from black by gray shades
to white. The bandwidth needed for SSTV transmission varies in
the range of 1.0 to 3.2\,kHz and depends on the SSTV mode,
transmission speed and also on image content, see
\in{fig.}[pic:fft].

Cheap modems (based on Hamcomm) do not use perfect continuous
harmonic signals, but also create the quantized signal. Step
changes between quantization levels require wider bandwidth, so
some image details can get lost.

    \externalfigure[sstv/obr/sstv_spectrum.pdf]
}

The emission classification code  for the SSTV mode is {\em
J3F}, which means:

\startitemize
\item {\em J}~-- Carrier modulation: Single-sideband with a suppressed carrier.
\item {\em 3}~-- Nature of modulating signal: One channel containing analog information.
\item {\em F}~-- Detail of signal: television signals.
\stopitemize

In the case of an SSTV transmission via a frequency modulated
(FM) channel, the emission is classified as {\em F3F} and {\em
A3F} for amplitude modulation (AM) with both sidebands.

\section[imgresol]{Image resolution}

{\em Resolution} is a feature that tells what amount of details is
possible to store in an image, see \in{fig.}[pic:araresol]. The
resolution has two parameters: {\em horizontal resolution}~-- the number
of image columns~$\times$ number of image lines~-- {\em the vertical
resolution}.

In analog television technology, the more important parameter is
the vertical resolution (number of lines) and it is defined by
the selection of the SSTV mode. To get the horizontal resolution
is more complicated.

As has been described in the previous text, the image is
broadcast through the SSB channel on short waves and the maximal
bandwidth is limited.

The SSTV is an {\em analog} mode and cannot transfer images
without loss. The image is not exactly the same on the reception
side as on the transmission side. Even if the communication
channel is without any interference or noise, the image is still
distorted due to transmission speed and limited bandwidth. The
faster the transmission speed is, the greater the distortion
result. Therefore it is very difficult to say what the
horizontal resolution of an SSTV image is.

Most of the modes carry images with 240 lines and the image is
displayed in a 4\,:\,3 aspect ratio on a screen. We can then say
that the number of columns is $240\times4/3=320$.  This value
then corresponds to a theoretical resolution, but not a {\em
real} image resolution.

The test chart (\in{fig.}[pic:resolution]) is used to qualify
the horizontal resolution of images. The resolution pattern
contains alternating stripes of black and white in various
densities from very rough to fine. There is a comparison of this
image with normal photography in \in{fig.}[pic:fft].

All SSTV modes in \in{figure}[pic:resolution] have 320 columns.
But as we can see, not all can transfer the image in actual
quality. The note in brackets describes the approximate time
needed for the transfer of one pixel. While with the Martin M2,
we can hardly distinguish the second fine grid, the M1 mode
with double transmission time can transfer it without problems,
but its finest pattern is distorted. Compare it to the real
picture in~\in{fig.}[pic:m1vsm2]. The last two modes listed have
longer times of transmission and can transfer the finest
details. Unfortunately, it is hardly compensated for by the slow
speed of transmission.
